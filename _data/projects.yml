# computer vision and ML
  - name: Image Segmentation
    categories: comp-viz py
    description: Image segmentation program using K-means clustering created in Python. Randomly initialized centers and adjustable number of clusters were used for 10 iterations. 
    #Within each of 10 iterations, I used color proximity calculated through Euclidean distance from each point to each cluster center to determine 'closeness'.

  - name: Person Detection
    categories: comp-viz py machine-learning
    description: SVM person detection algorithm created in Python to detect people in mall video frames. Suitable features were computed using HoG in order to train the SVM. 
    # The training set was created using 5000 random positive samples and 8000 negative samples. Finally, a sliding window program was created to detect people in new images, and the results were processed and displayed using bounding boxes.

  - name: Face Detection
    categories: comp-viz py machine-learning
    description: 100 random celebrity faces were used to form an artificial 'average face' and compute the top 'eigenfaces'. The program performs face detection using a sliding window on any input to find patches with low RMSE.

  - name: Recycling Robot
    categories: emb-sys java games
    description: Autonomous recycling robot created with Java and LeJOS for a LEGO Mindstorms EV3. We built colour and weight detection systems to sort recycling cans, as well as fully autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance (like a Roomba).
